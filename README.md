# Kadam - Offline AI-Powered Learning Platform

Kadam is an offline AI-powered learning platform that uses Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model to provide intelligent feedback and generate educational content, all without requiring an internet connection.

## Features

- üìö Interactive learning modules (comics, passages, questions)
- ü§ñ Offline AI assistance powered by Phi-3 Mini
- üìù Multiple question types (MCQ, reorder, free text)
- üí° Word vault and hints functionality
- üéØ Personalized learning experience

## Installation

### macOS

1. Download `Kadam-1.0.2-arm64.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ahoski/Kadam-Mac/releases)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag Kadam to your Applications folder

#### Important: Handling "Damaged App" Warning

Since this app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS Gatekeeper may show a warning that the app is "damaged". This is a security feature, not an actual problem with the app.

**To fix this, run the following command in Terminal:**

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Kadam.app
```

Or, if you haven't moved it to Applications yet:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Volumes/Kadam 1.0.2-arm64/Kadam.app"
```

After running this command, you should be able to open Kadam normally.

**Alternative method:**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on Kadam.app
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog

### First Launch

On first launch, Kadam will prompt you to download the AI model (~2.4 GB). This is a one-time download, and after that, Kadam works completely offline.
